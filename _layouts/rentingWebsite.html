            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              In renting processes, tenants feel low security, no confidence in
              realtors or homeowners, they are disenchanted, and some of them
              fear the unknown. The renting process is complicated, offers don’t
              represent reality and it is a nuisance for tenants having to show
              the house to new possible tenants.

                Julia is an office worker that has experience in renting, but
                she has too many bad experiences. She feels disenchanted, misled
                and vulnerable with the renting process, rented houses, realtors
                and home owners. She needs to find something that fits her
                needs, that give her more security and helps her gain confidence
                and more access to benefits.

              <h4>Low confidence</h4>
              <br />
              <p>
                Offers don’t represent reality. Sometimes realtors and
                homeowners deceive tenants. This cause tenants to feel insecure,
                vulnerable and disenchanted.

                Homeowners sometimes burden their tenants with responsibilities

                Usually, the website process of renting a house is complicated
                and cause the users to feel misled and confused. Tenants have to
                run and compete to have their chosen house with little margin.

                Some users feel anxiety about changing homes and not finding a
                house equal or better to their current home. Not having guides
                in those websites to help users find something that meets their
                needs increase their unease.

            This project is made using graceful degradation. First paper
            wireframes, digital wireframes and a low fidelity website prototype
            were made. The mobile prototype was made and tested on a usability
            study, then, the website & mobile high fidelity prototypes were
            created. Finally, the prototypes were tested and pulished for a
            final product.
