            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              In renting processes, tenants feel low security, no confidence in
              realtors or homeowners, they are disenchanted, and some of them
              fear the unknown. The renting process is complicated, offers don’t
              represent reality and it is a nuisance for tenants having to show
              the house to new possible tenants.

                Offers don’t represent reality. Sometimes realtors and

            This project is made using agraceful degradation approach. First I
            created the website information architecture. Then paper wireframes,
            digital wireframes and a low fidelity website prototype were made.
            The mobile prototype was made and tested on a usability study, then
            the designs were refined and the website & mobile high fidelity
            prototypes were created. Finally, the prototypes were tested and
            pulished for a final product.
