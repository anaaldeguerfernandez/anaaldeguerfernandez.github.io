            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              In renting processes, tenants feel low security, no confidence in
              realtors or homeowners, they are disenchanted, and some of them
              fear the unknown. The renting process is complicated, offers don’t
              represent reality and it is a nuisance for tenants having to show
              the house to new possible tenants.
