            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              In certain times of the year flower shops are overwhelmed and it
              is very difficult to manage orders for them. Long queues are
              formed at shops and if bouquets are not ordered in advance the
              result sometimes is not what clients are waiting for.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Design a flower shop app that allows users easily order and
              pick-up orders through the application and allows a high degree of
              customization whenever the user wants.
