            <p>
              In certain times of the year flower shops are overwhelmed and it
              is difficult to manage orders for them. Long queues are formed at
              shops and if bouquets are not ordered in advance results sometimes
              are not what clients wait.

            “In the flower shop I like close treatment, I don't think I would
            use it. In case of a long queue in the store and having a screen
            inside the store with this application to speed up my order, I would
            use it. Using it from home gives you comfort.”
