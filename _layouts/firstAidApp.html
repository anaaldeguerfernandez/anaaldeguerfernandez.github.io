            First paper wireframes, digital wireframes and a low fidelity mobile
            prototype were made. The low fidelity mobile prototype was tested on
            a usability study and then updated with the feedback received.
            Digital wireframes and low fidelity prototypes were created for
            tablet and mobile devices. Finally, mockups and high fidelity
            prototypes were created.
