              while working. It was identified a lack of first aid knowledge and
              emergency assistance. For those who knew first aid, there was
              identified a lack of something that let them be up to date and
              centralize first aid information.

                first-aid, but she has little knowledge about it. She doesn't

          <p>
            This project is made using progresive enhancement. First paper
            wireframes, digital wireframes and low fidelity mobile prototype
            were made. Digital wireframes and low fidelity website prototype
            were made. The low fidelity prototype was tested on a usability
            study and then updated with the feedback received. Digital
            wireframes and low fidelity prototypes were created for tablet and
            mobile devices. Finally, mockups and high fidelity prototypes were
            created.
